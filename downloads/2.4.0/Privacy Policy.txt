Privacy Policy for Icon Thingy
Last Updated: January 2026

1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how Icon Thingy ("the Application") handles your information. "We," "Us," or "Our" refers to the developer (Andrew).

We believe in privacy by design. The Application is designed to function entirely offline and does not collect, store, or transmit your personal data.

2. Data Collection
We do not collect, store, or share any personal information.

No Account Required: You do not need to create an account to use the Application.

No Analytics: We do not track how you use the Application (no Google Analytics, no telemetry).

No Network Access: The Application does not connect to the internet.

3. How We Handle Your Files
The core function of Icon Thingy is to process images (PNG, JPG, WEBP, etc.) to create icon files (.ICO).

Local Processing: All image processing happens locally on your device's memory and hard drive.

No Uploads: Your images are never uploaded to a server or cloud service.

Temporary Data: The Application loads your image into system memory (RAM) to apply effects (cropping, rounding) and saves the result to the location you specify. Once the Application is closed, this data is cleared from memory.

4. Third-Party Libraries
The Application uses the following open-source libraries to function:

Magick.NET (ImageMagick): Used for image processing. This library runs locally on your machine and is subject to the Apache 2.0 License.

To the best of our knowledge, these libraries do not collect user data in this implementation.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Since the Application does not collect contact information, we advise you to review this policy periodically if you update the Application.
